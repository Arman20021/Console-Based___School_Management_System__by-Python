🏫 Console-Based School Management System (Python)

This project is a console-based School Management System built using Python. It provides an interactive interface for managing essential school operations such as students, teachers, classes, and exams — all through the terminal.

The system demonstrates key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, while maintaining clean and modular code design.
